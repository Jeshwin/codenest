## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

CodeNest is a fully-featured, web-based code editor that allows anyone to implement their ideas without any need to install new software. Through our platform, you can access any development environment, create a new project in any programming language, and run it hassle-free on the cloud, all without leaving your browser window.

We initially started CodeNest to gain experience working on a large project as a group. Eventually, CodeNest became a proof-of-concept, an idea that we could keep building into a reality. Our goal is that CodeNest becomes a gateway to new programmers, making coding more accessible to the world.
